## About

This is a educational program for learning the U.S states. Users are prompted to guess a state.
If the user guesses correctly the map will display the state on the map. The prompt will also the 
current score. Once the user is done, enter "exit". This will end the program and save the missing
states into a csv file named "states_to_learn".
